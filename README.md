A place where I put random Python functions or scripts of Python related to Nuke

## Knob Changed folder
Those are callbacks that I used in some of the tools that I made and compiled in functions. They are:
* **createInput.py**: creates one input taking as a reference the input, their name, the node that will be connected, which connection, and with xpos and ypos will be connected. I used a similar one in the [emMatte](https://github.com/emateofabregas/emMatte) node and other nodes.
* **removeNode.py**: This function removes a custom node. I used a similar one in the [emMatte](https://github.com/emateofabregas/emMatte) node and other nodes.
* **sampleThreeD.py**: This function takes the 2d knob (picker_knob) using nodeSample as a reference for setting up 3D position info (pos_knob). I used a similar one in the [emMatte](https://github.com/emateofabregas/emMatte) node and other nodes.
